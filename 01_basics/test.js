/*
JavaScript is a dynamic language, meaning that variables can hold different types of values during runtime: 
Dynamic typing
In dynamically typed languages, type checking is done at runtime, which means that the data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime. This allows you to assign anything you want to a variable and it will work. 
Static typing
In statically typed languages, the compiler catches type-related errors before the program runs. This leads to more reliable code
